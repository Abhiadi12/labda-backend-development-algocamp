1. Client and Server architecture

- client responsible to display the UI, user interaction and capable of initiate of request to DNS
- server process the request, access os resource and DB access. Heavy computation.
- ex: place an order in zomato.

2. How the communication works ?

- TCP n/w stack (Application, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical)
- OSI n/w stack (Application, Presentation Layer, Session Layer Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical)
- each layer is responsible for some task and guarantee a secure communication.
- This are the concepts how the N/W life cycle works.

3. Application layer ? -> UI is stay here. It is the first step of n/w communication.
